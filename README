Matt's Ten Minute Hax'a is proud to present ncolor. An output filter
to colorize the output of commands. Also it will timestamp output for
you if you are so inclined. Options are

ncolor [-t <colorspec>] [-s] [-c] [-a <n>]
-c Clear the screen
-s Suppress the timestamp
-t Sets the colorspec
-a Set the skip for the timestamping
