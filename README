Matt's Ten Minute Hax'a is proud to present ncolor. An output fillter
to colorize the output of commands. Also it will time stamp output for
you if you are so inclined. Options are

ncolor [-t <colorspec>] [-s] [-c] [-a <n>] 
-c Clear the screen 
-s Supress the timestamp 
-t Sets the colorspec
-a Set the skip for the timestamping
